# markdownToHTML
Implemented a program that opened a text file created by the user, parsed the file, and converted elements of the text file
into HMTL code.
Created eight symbols that correspond to HTML tags. If a symbol was found in the text file, it would be converted to its
associated HTML tag.
Utilized the fundamental C concepts such as file handling, text parsing, string manipulation, dynamic memory allocation,
and the use of pointers.
